# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create new data models and DTOs for chat functionality
  - Create ChatMessage, ChatHistoryResponse, and StoreChatMessagesRequest DTOs in Engine/Models
  - Update ChatRequestDto to include UserId field
  - Write unit tests for new data models
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement Accessor client for Engine service
  - Create IAccessorClient interface in Engine/Services/Clients directory
  - Implement AccessorClient class with GetChatHistoryAsync and StoreChatMessagesAsync methods
  - Add Dapr client integration for HTTP method invocation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 3. Update AiEndpoints with enhanced chat endpoint logic
  - Modify existing /chat endpoint to handle new ChatRequestDto format with userId
  - Add request validation for required fields (threadId, userMessage, userId)
  - Call Accessor service to get chat history for the threadId
  - Send chat history with new message to AI service to get OpenAI response with context
  - After getting AI response, send both question and answer to Accessor to store in database
  - Return AI response to the Manager
  - Handle exceptions and implement proper error response formatting for all failure scenarios

- [ ] 4. Register new services and dependencies
  - Register IAccessorClient and AccessorClient in Engine Program.cs
  - Configure Dapr client for Engine service if not already configured
  - Update AutoMapper profiles if needed for new DTOs
  - Verify all dependency injection is properly configured
  - _Requirements: All requirements support_
